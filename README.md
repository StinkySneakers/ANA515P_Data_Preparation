# ANA515P_Data_Preparation

This is the assignment submission for ANA515P 2023 summer. The purpose is to practice cleaning and preparing data from a raw dataset.

The data comes from NYC parents reporting their kidsâ€™ scores on the Gifted and Talented exam, as well as school preferences.
Columns include time of survey, entering grade level, district, month of birth, OLSAT and NNAT scores and percentiles, and school preferences.

The surveys were taken for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years.

Data cleaning were made based on format consistency, bad data removal, and NA filling principles. Detailed methods were included in comments and code.

The cleaned data can be used to derive statistics on the general outcome of the GT exam (scores) and the school preferences of the participating families.
